# Raw2Road-Insights
a whole preprocessing system for used cars data
# 🚗 Raw2Road Insights: Used Cars Data Engineering

An end-to-end Data Engineering project designed to transform raw, messy used car data into a clean, structured format ready for Machine Learning.

## 🛠️ Key Features
- **Regex Cleaning:** Extracted numeric values from strings (Price, Mileage).
- **Target Encoding:** Handled high-cardinality categorical features (Brand, Model) without increasing dimensions.
- **Outlier Management:** Applied IQR Capping to stabilize the data.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Built with Streamlit to visualize "Before vs. After" processing steps.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Visualization:** Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Engineering:** Scikit-learn (StandardScaler)
- **Deployment:** Streamlit Cloud
